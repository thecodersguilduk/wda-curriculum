# OOUX and Object Mapping
Last reviewed **28 Aug 2018** by **Crispin Read**

## Description
This session is about the connections between what we do as developers and what we do as UX practitioners. Specifically it is about the impact on UX that we can have as developers. 'Object Mapping' is a discovery technique
### Why this is important
Many attributes of software development contribute to the **user experience** and we need to think of programming as a creative process and part of a larger effort. UX does not exist soley in the relms of 'design'either - and we should be ever mindful of the impacts and benefits we can deliver throughout the development process.
