# Source control
Last reviewed **04 Sept 2019** by **Crispin Read**

## Description
In this session we'll learn more about change management and version control using git. In particular we'll be looking at some of the more common workflows that sit alongside source control.

### Why this is important
Source control makes it possible for multiple developers work on the same code at the same time. Workflows enable us to communicate better and can install additional process into our work to make sure we are solving the problems at hand while producing the best code possible.

## Outcomes

At the end of this training you will be able to:
  1. Know all the basic commands of git
  1. Understand the three most common git workflows and where they are most appropriate
