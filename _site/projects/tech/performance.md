# Performance

Last reviewed **13 July 2021** by **Gareth Midwood**

## Description

In this session we will look at website performance, what it means and why it is important. We'll also be looking at some of the tools we can use to measure performance and what we should be looking to improve.

### Why this is important

Fast websites means better UX, high return visits, low bounce rates, higher conversions, greater engagement, and higher ranks in organic search. Slow websites cost us (and our clients) money and damage reputations.

## Outcomes

At the end of this training you will be able to:

1. Understand the importance of website performance from a business perspective
1. Use tools to test the performance of websites

## Learner Requirements

1. A site to audit for takeaway task
